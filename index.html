        <center><p style="color: rgb(150, 115, 66)">My dad is the second youngest of seven brothers. He works 
            at Ashley, and he is a tidy person. He is also very respectful and kind; he always listens to what you 
            have to say, which is what inspired me to become an active listener. He is liked by many due to his 
            attitude, personality, and the way he treats others, as well as his respect for everyone. My dad is 
            serious but respectful with others, but when he's at home, he's always joking around with us and making 
            us laugh. He's considerate and kind, and he does as much as he can to help us out. I will always have 
            respect for my dad. Overall, my dad is a great person, and he inspired me to be a good person to others,
             even when they aren't nice back.</p></center>

        <center><h2 style="color: rgb(165, 108, 42)">What's he great at?</h2></center>
            <center><p style="color: rgb(150, 115, 66)">My dad is a great parent. When I was younger, he had to take care of me and my brothers by himself.
            Even when times were hard for him, he always supported me and my decisions, and he would give me
            advice when I would struggle. He never gave up on me, and he would constantly remind me that he would
            always be there for me, even if he's busy. He would also always remind me not to be too hard on myself.</center></p>

            <center><p style="color: rgb(150, 115, 66)">I chose him to be my goat because he was there for me from the very beginning, and even when things
            were really hard on him, he never gave up on himself or us. If anything, he worked on himself to be a
            better person and to be a good role model for his kids to look up to. He would always be willing to
            help us out even when he was busy, and would make sure to make time for us. After all that he's been
            through, he continues to be a good person. I knew I wanted to make this project on him because he inspired
            me a lot, and also because I want him to know that I love him.</center></p>
